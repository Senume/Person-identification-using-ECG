# Person Identification
## **INTRODUCTION**
This repository contains the implementation of the research paper titled "An integration of features for person identification based on the
PQRST fragments of ECG signals". The paper presents a novel approach to identify the subjects using PQRST fragments of the electrocardiogram (ECG)
signal[^1]. Our method is based on identification the system which has three principal steps, namely preprocessing, features extraction, and classification.

The code in this repository is organized into. 
- src : Contains all the codes files, files have been named based on its functions. 
- Features : Features extarcated from the ECG signal are availale in this directory.

To run the code, install neccessary dependencies. 

Note : Model Training is not done on MIT_BIH features file.
